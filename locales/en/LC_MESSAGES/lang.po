# Pod latency

msgid "POD_LATENCY_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Pod latency is how long it takes a pod to start up (after being scheduled) while the cluster is under load."

msgid "POD_LATENCY_GOOD"
msgstr "<span style=\"color: rgb(9, 171, 59);\">Pods are taking the expected amount of time to start.</span>"

msgid "POD_LATENCY_BAD"

msgid "FSYNC_DURATION_BELOW_EXPECTATIONS"
msgstr "<span style=\"color: #ffcb00\">Sync durations are taking longer than usual. This could indicate disk issues that could lead to request latency and destabilization of the cluster.</span>"

msgid "FSYNC_DURATION_BAD"
msgstr "<span style=\"color: red\">Sync durations are taking too long. This indicates disk issues that could lead to request latency and destabilization of the cluster.</span>"

# etcd leader changes

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Etcd is supposed to always have a leader. Leader changes indicate that there is a performance or stability issue with the leader."

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_GOOD"
msgstr "<span style=\"color: rgb(9, 171, 59);\">Etcd leader changes are within expectations.</span>"

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_BELOW_EXPECTATIONS"
msgstr "<span style=\"color: #ffcb00\">Etcd leaders changes are greater than expected. The performance may be degraded, and the etcd leader may be less stable.</span>"

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_BAD"
msgstr "<span style=\"color: red\">Etcd leader changes are happening rapidly. The performance is likely significantly degraded and the leader could be unstable.</span>"
