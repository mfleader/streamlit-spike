# ================================================== #
# Explanations for metrics

# Pod latency

msgid "POD_LATENCY_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Pod latency is how long it takes a pod to start up while the cluster is under load"

msgid "POD_LATENCY_GOOD"
msgstr "Pods are taking the expected amount of time to start."

msgid "POD_LATENCY_BELOW_EXPECTATIONS"
msgstr "Pods are taking a little too long to start. This could mean resources are strained."

msgid "POD_LATENCY_BAD"
msgstr "Pods are taking much longer than expected to start. Resources are likely strained."


# etcd health

msgid "ETCD_HEALTH_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Etcd is a critical component of distributed system like OpenShift."

msgid "ETCD_HEALTH_GOOD"
msgstr "Etcd is passing all included health checks."

msgid "ETCD_HEALTH_BELOW_EXPECTATIONS"
msgstr "Etcd is failing some health checks! Cluster performance may be degraded. See the advanced metrics for more info."

msgid "ETCD_HEALTH_BAD"
msgstr "Etcd is failing all included health metrics! Cluster performance will be degraded. See the advanced metrics for more info."


# etcd fsync duration

msgid "FSYNC_DURATION_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "How long it takes to sync etcd log entries to the disk storage."

msgid "FSYNC_DURATION_GOOD"
msgstr "Sync durations are within expectations."

msgid "FSYNC_DURATION_BELOW_EXPECTATIONS"
msgstr "Sync durations are taking longer than usual. This could indicate disk issues that could lead to request latency and destabilization of the cluster."

msgid "FSYNC_DURATION_BAD"
msgstr "Sync durations are taking too long. This indicates disk issues that could lead to request latency and destabilization of the cluster."

# etcd leader changes

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Etcd is supposed to always have a leader. Leader changes indicate that there is a performance or stability issue with the leader."

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_GOOD"
msgstr "Etcd leader changes are within expectations."

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_BELOW_EXPECTATIONS"
msgstr "Etcd leaders changes are greater than expected. The performance may be degraded, and the etcd leader may be less stable."

msgid "ETCD_LEADER_CHANGES_BAD"
msgstr "Etcd leader changes are happening rapidly. The performance is likely significantly degraded and the leader could be unstable."
